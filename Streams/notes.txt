Base abstract classes available in the stream core module

1. Readable (represents a source of data)
2. Writable ( represents a data destination)
3. Duplex (a stream that is both readable and writable)
4. Transform (special kind of duplex stream that is designed to handle data transformations, they apply some
transformation to the data that they receive on their writable side and then make that data available on their readable
side)

Note: Each stream class is also an instance of eventEmitter.

Operating modes: 
1. Binary mode
2. Object mode
